        <h3>The Tenure Process</h3>
        <p style="color: #942811">Please read the following carefully before you start evaluation. This page will remain accessible for reference.</p>
        </br>
        <h4>What is academic tenure?</h4>
        <p>
            A tenure appointment is an indefinite appointment that can be terminated only with proper cause and due process.
            Academic tenure is intended to protect educators against termination for personal, arbitrary, or political
            reasons. In applicable states, every teacher can become eligible for tenure after completing a probationary
            period determined by law (for this case, the state’s required probation period is 4 years).
            After the end of the probation period, every teacher goes through a rigorous process where a board reviews
            the teacher’s profile and determines whether they meet requirements for tenure. Accomplishing tenure,
            in states that provide it, is a monument milestone in every teacher’s career

        <!--<h4>What is a probationary period?</h4>-->
        <!--<p>-->
            <!--State law requires every teacher to serve for a period of time before becoming eligible for tenure; this is referred to as probationary period. During this period (in our case 4 years) teachers are regularly reviewed by supervisors to evaluate them in areas such as planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction and professional responsibilities. At the end of the probationary period, a teacher becomes eligible for tenure.-->

        <h4>What are the requirements for tenure?</h4>
        <p>
            Tenure is not automatic after the end of the probationary period. The process of determining tenure is rigorous and involves input from multiple sources. Every teacher must prove capable of meeting the rigorous requirements expected of tenured faculty. A teacher to achieve tenure must prove evidence of qualification on the following job functions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong>Student Learning: </strong>tenure applicants must provide consistent evidence showing that all students, including those with special needs, perform competitively on state standard exams for academic qualifications.
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong>Instructional Practice: </strong>tenure applicants must provide consistent evidence indicating practice at the most effective level in the categories below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Planning and preparation</li>
                    <li>Classroom environment</li>
                    <li>Instruction</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li style="margin-bottom:20px"><strong>Professionalism: </strong>tenure applicants must provide consistent evidence of high level professionalism on activities including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Professional growth and reflection</li>
                    <li>Collaboration and engagement with the school community</li>
                    <li>Effective communication with students’ families</li>
                    <li>Management of non-instructional responsibilities</li>
                    <li>Professional conduct</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h4>What is your requirement for this exercise?</h4>
        <p>
            In order to ensure most transperency in the tenure selection process, the board decided to solicit outside recommendation on tenure decisions. In what follows you will be asked to make such recommendations for ten different pairs of teachers. For each decision you will be provided with two dossiers for teachers eligible for tenure. The dossiers will be available for evaluation side by side. Each dossier includes supervisors' evaluation of teachers on different job functions. You can read as many such evaluation as you think necessary before being able to make selection recommendation. After making your recommendation, of on each selection decision, you'll be asked to explain breifly the reason for your recommendation and your confidence in your choice.
