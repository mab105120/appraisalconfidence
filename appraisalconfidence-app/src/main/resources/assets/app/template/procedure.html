            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                Every year high schools, in states that provide tenure, must decide which teachers would be promoted for tenure.
                This year, in an initiative to improve its tenure selection process, the tenure board at Kingston High Schoolâ€™s (K.H.S) <sup>*</sup>
                decided to solicit outside input on its tenure decisions. The board believes that accepting outside
                counsel would increase diversity of opinion and ensure justice in the selection process. K.H.S is committed to providing students
                with highest quality of education, a goal possible only by promoting the best educators.

                On the next page we explain what tenure is, what is required of teachers to be promoted for tenure, and how you could help us make sure
                that our promotion process is transparent, fair, and effective. Please be mindful that your responses, along with other factors, will be used in
                the final promotion decisions. We appreciate your commitment.
